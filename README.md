#EasyGoSquared Plugin

A simple Joomla plugin that adds the GoSquared analytics scripts to your pages automatically.

##Basic Usage Steps
  1. Install via the standard Joomla extension manager and enable it.
  2. Enable the plugin.
  3. Add the GoSquared Token for the website. 
  4. _There is no step 4…_
  
##Options

EasyGoSquared can be enabled for backend logging as well. Simply set the "Admin Analytics" to **Yes**.

It's important to understand that GoSquared is a commercial service and while this plug-in is free you do need a GoSquared account.

##Notes
 - This plugin only supports Joomla 3. 
 - This plugin requires PHP 5.4 or higher.
 - This installs without any errors, runs on Joomla 3, doesn't throw `STRICT WARNINGS`, doesn't used deprecated Joomla calls and runs as a CONTENT plugin — unlike the 0.3 version from [GoSquared on the JED](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension/site-management/analytics/gosquared).
